# Security Policy for ClarusAI

## Overview

ClarusAI is a HIPAA-compliant healthcare AI platform for medical imaging analysis. This document outlines our security practices and guidelines for contributors.

## Security Principles

### 1. Data Protection
- All patient health information (PHI) must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Personal identifiers must be handled according to HIPAA regulations
- Medical images must be stored securely with appropriate access controls
- Database connections must use encrypted connections

### 2. Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented for all user types
- Multi-factor authentication is required for all users
- Session management includes automatic timeout and secure session invalidation
- Audit logging tracks all access to PHI

### 3. Secure Development
- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through output encoding
- CSRF protection on all state-changing operations

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
Never commit sensitive configuration to version control. Use environment variables or Azure Key Vault for:
- Database connection strings
- API keys and secrets
- Encryption keys
- JWT signing keys
- Third-party service credentials

### Required Security Headers
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

### Database Security
- Use parameterized queries exclusively
- Implement database connection pooling with proper timeout
- Enable SQL Server encryption (TDE)
- Regular database backup with encryption
- Separate read/write connection strings where applicable

## File Upload Security

### Allowed File Types
- Medical images: DICOM, JPEG, PNG
- Maximum file size: 100MB
- Virus scanning required for all uploads
- Files stored outside web root directory

### File Validation
```csharp
[RegularExpression(@"^(image/|application/dicom)", ErrorMessage = "Only image files and DICOM files are allowed")]
public string ContentType { get; set; }
```

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Configuration
- Minimum 256-bit signing key
- 1-hour token expiration
- Refresh token rotation
- Secure token storage (HttpOnly cookies)

### Role Permissions
- Administrator: Full system access
- Radiologist: Medical image analysis and reporting
- Clinician: Patient data access and analysis requests
- Technician: Image upload and basic viewing
- Viewer: Read-only access to assigned patients

## Data Validation

### Input Validation Rules
- All DTOs include comprehensive validation attributes
- Server-side validation for all user inputs
- Medical record number format validation
- Email and phone number format validation
- Date range validation for medical data

### Example Validation
```csharp
[Required]
[StringLength(50, MinimumLength = 2)]
[RegularExpression(@"^[a-zA-Z\s]+$", ErrorMessage = "Name can only contain letters and spaces")]
public string FirstName { get; set; }
```

## Encryption Standards

### Data at Rest
- AES-256 encryption for all PHI
- Separate encryption keys per tenant/organization
- Key rotation every 90 days
- Keys stored in Azure Key Vault

### Data in Transit
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Certificate pinning for external APIs
- Encrypted database connections
- Secure file transfer protocols

## Audit Logging

### Required Audit Events
- User authentication attempts
- Patient data access
- Medical image views/downloads
- Analysis request submissions
- Administrative actions
- System errors and security events

### Audit Log Security
- Immutable audit logs
- Cryptographic integrity verification
- Separate audit database
- Regular audit log reviews

## Incident Response

### Security Event Classification
- **Critical**: Data breach, unauthorized PHI access
- **High**: Authentication bypass, privilege escalation
- **Medium**: DoS attacks, suspicious activity
- **Low**: Failed login attempts, minor configuration issues

### Response Procedures
1. Immediate containment of security incidents
2. Assessment of affected systems and data
3. Notification procedures (HIPAA breach notification)
4. Remediation and recovery procedures
5. Post-incident review and improvements

## Compliance Requirements

### HIPAA Compliance
- Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) required
- Minimum necessary standard enforcement
- Patient consent management
- Data breach notification procedures
- Employee training and access controls

### Technical Safeguards
- Access control (unique user identification)
- Audit controls (hardware, software, procedural)
- Integrity controls (PHI alteration/destruction protection)
- Person or entity authentication
- Transmission security (guard against unauthorized access)

## Development Guidelines

### Secure Coding Practices
- Never log sensitive information
- Use parameterized queries exclusively
- Validate all inputs (whitelist approach)
- Implement proper error handling
- Use secure random number generation

### Code Review Requirements
- All code must be reviewed for security issues
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Manual security review for authentication/authorization changes
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Vulnerability Reporting

### Reporting Security Issues
Please report security vulnerabilities to: security@clarusai.com

### Responsible Disclosure
- Report issues privately before public disclosure
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
- Allow reasonable time for remediation
- Follow coordinated disclosure timeline

## Dependencies and Third-Party Libraries

### Security Scanning
